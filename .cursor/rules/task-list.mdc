# Task List - Charbit Codeworks Portfolio

## âœ… Completed Tasks
- **Vercel 404 Routing Fix**: Created `vercel.json` configuration file with rewrite rules for SPA routing
- **Route Verification**: Confirmed all routes (/, /home, 404 catch-all) are properly configured
- **Build Configuration Review**: Verified Vite build setup is compatible with Vercel deployment

## ðŸ“‹ Current Configuration
- **Framework**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Routing**: React Router (BrowserRouter) 
- **UI Library**: Radix UI + shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment**: Vercel (with proper SPA routing configuration)
- **Database**: Supabase Postgres (as specified in rules)
- **Localization**: Hebrew RTL, ILS currency, DD/MM/YYYY dates (to be implemented)

## ðŸš€ Routes Structure
- `/` - Splash screen (auto-redirects to /home after 4s)
- `/home` - Main portfolio page (Index component)
- `*` - 404 Not Found page

## ðŸ”§ Recent Changes
- Added `vercel.json` with rewrite rules to fix 404 errors on page refresh
- This allows client-side routing to work properly on Vercel deployment

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps (if needed)
- Implement Hebrew localization (RTL layout, ILS currency, DD/MM/YYYY dates)
- Connect Supabase database if dynamic content is required
- Add any additional features as requested
